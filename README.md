# Q-learning Task 1 : gridworld

Hello there. This is a repository of No.4 Group of 2019 USTC Summer Camp on AI.

## The following is the original document

To get started, run Gridworld in manual control mode, which uses the arrow keys:

```python
python gridworld.py -m
```

- Files you'll edit:
  - qlearningAgents.py 	Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.

- Files you should read but NOT edit:
  - mdp.py 	Defines methods on general MDPs.
  - learningAgents.py 	Defines the base classes ValueEstimationAgent and QLearningAgent, which your agents will extend.
  - util.py 	Utilities, including util.Counter, which is particularly useful for Q-learners.
  - gridworld.py 	The Gridworld implementation.
  - featureExtractors.py 	Classes for extracting features on (state,action) pairs. Used for the approximate Q-learning agent (in qlearningAgents.py).

- Files you can ignore:
  - environment.py 	Abstract class for general reinforcement learning environments. Used by gridworld.py.
  - graphicsGridworldDisplay.py 	Gridworld graphical display.
  - graphicsUtils.py 	Graphics utilities.
  - textGridworldDisplay.py 	Plug-in for the Gridworld text interface.
